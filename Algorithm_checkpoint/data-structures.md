### ‚úçÔ∏è **My Visualgo Exploration Summary**

#### ‚úÖ **Data Structures I'm Familiar With:**

| Data Structure | Confidence Level | Notes                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Array          | ‚úÖ High           | I use this daily in JavaScript.                                                                                                                                        |
| Linked List    | ‚úÖ High           | I understand traversal, insertion, and deletion.                                                                                                                       |
| Stack          | ‚úÖ High           | Clear understanding of LIFO behavior.                                                                                                                                  |
| Queue          | ‚úÖ High           | FIFO and common use-cases like task scheduling are clear.                                                                                                              |
| Hash Table     | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate      | I understand the concept, but **I‚Äôm not yet confident in applying it practically in JavaScript**, especially regarding **collision resolution and hashing functions**. |

#### ‚ùì **Why I'm Not Yet Mastering Hash Tables**

* I understand **theory** (key-value storage, fast access).
* But I struggle with:

  * Writing a **hash function from scratch**.
  * Handling **collisions** (chaining vs. open addressing).
  * Applying it in **real-world problems** (e.g., building a dictionary, caching, duplicate detection).
* I‚Äôve mostly used built-in objects like `{}` and `Map` in JS, so **lower-level implementation feels unfamiliar**.

#### üß† **Sorting Algorithms I'm Comfortable With:**

| Sorting Algorithm   | Confidence  | Notes                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bubble Sort         | ‚úÖ High      | Understand inefficiency and use-case.                                                    |
| Insertion Sort      | ‚úÖ High      | Easy to implement and visualize.                                                         |
| Selection Sort      | ‚úÖ High      | Simple, though not efficient for large datasets.                                         |
| Merge Sort          | ‚úÖ Good      | I follow divide-and-conquer and can write it.                                            |
| Quick Sort          | ‚úÖ Good      | Understand partitioning and recursion.                                                   |
| Heap Sort           | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate | The **heap construction** and **heapify** process still take time for me to trace/debug. |
| Counting/Radix Sort | ‚ö†Ô∏è Low      | Haven‚Äôt applied these practically yet; need clarity on when to use them effectively.     |

### ‚úÖ **What I'll Do Next to Improve:**

1. **Implement a Hash Table from scratch** in JavaScript.
2. **Solve toy problems** using only custom hash tables ‚Äî not built-in JS objects.
3. Revisit **collision handling techniques** using visualgo and YouTube animations.
4. Practice **Heap Sort** and **non-comparison-based algorithms** like Radix and Counting Sort.
